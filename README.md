### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

- I think the topics discussed in the labs really prepared me for this assignment. It was really easy to also follow along the steps of the labs while working on your project. One thing that helped me  lot was the set up of the backend and the videos explaning the routes with examples of code and a biref description of what it was doing.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
- If i had more time i would have loved to try and implement the different users. I beleive those would have helped me learn for my capstone project. As far as additional features i thought it would be cool to be have the option when secting an image to be able to upload one of your own images.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

- We still haven't demoed. We will be demoing on Monday, June 24, 2024. I will come back and update the doc then.

### Shout out

- I want to give a shout out to Andrew who helped me better understand how the communication between the frontend and backend worked by providing examples and explaning in detail. I aslo want to give a shout out to Diego and Nick who helped me with the searching gifs functionality.
